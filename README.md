# Atto Image Plugin with AI-Powered Alt Text Generation

## Small Description

The Atto Image Plugin for Moodle, originally developed to facilitate image insertion and manipulation in the text editor, has been enhanced with AI-powered capabilities. This extended version now offers automatic alt text generation using OpenAI-compatible Language Models
## Original Functionality (2013)
The original Atto Image plugin, developed by Damyon Wiese in 2013, provides essential image insertion and manipulation features for the Moodle text editor. Key features include:

- Image upload and insertion into the editor
- URL-based image insertion
- Image alignment options (left, center, right)
- Image sizing (width and height)
- Alt text input for accessibility
- Image preview

## New AI-Powered Extensions (2024)
In 2024, Ries Patrick extended the plugin to include AI-powered alt text generation using OpenAI-compatible Language Models (LLMs). The new features include:

1. **Automatic Alt Text Generation**: 
   - Utilizes OpenAI-compatible APIs to generate descriptive alt text for images.
   - Supports multiple languages for alt text generation.

2. **Language Selection**:
   - Users can choose from multiple languages for alt text generation.
   - The language selection is configurable in the Moodle admin settings.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implements a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent API abuse.

4. **Image Scaling**:
   - Automatically scales large images before sending to the AI service to optimize performance and reduce API costs.

5. **Customizable API Settings**:
   - Allows administrators to configure API key, URL, model, and other parameters.

6. **Detail Level Control**:
   - Administrators can set the detail level for image analysis (none, low, high, auto).

7. **Multilingual Support**:
   - The plugin interface supports multiple languages through Moodle's language system.
